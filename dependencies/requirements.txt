# requirements.txt

# Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, but if you need to install it separately, you can use:
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
#sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# If you are using a specific environment where tkinter is not available, you might need to install it.
# Uncomment the line below if needed.
# tk

# No additional third-party libraries are required for this project as it uses standard libraries.

#Use the .sh files for linux distros and .bat for windows
